# KLE-Render
Tool to convert raw code from Keyboard-Layout-Editor.com to and OBJ/MTL format for rendering

To use, create a layout using the GB:Retro DSA template found here: http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/samples/gb-retro-dsa

Copy and paste the raw data, which is found under the raw data tab, into the program, and it'll spit out an mtl file for use with my obj file.  Runnable JAR file and OBJ file for use with generated MTLs can be found here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/knpimh0lpt0lzzu/KLE-Render%20v1.11.zip?dl=0

Import into a rendering engine of your choice and render it.

To-Do List:
-Fix DSA keys looking so nasty (IN PROGRESS)
-Add different key profiles (currently thinking about SA/DCS/Cherry)
-Fix keyboard base looking so boring
-Add different keyboard formats (bigass enter, ergodox)
-Add support for different fonts (unlikely)
